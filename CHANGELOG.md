# Changelog

All notable changes to the AnyVac companion integration are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Room names** — `rooms[].name` is now filled in from the Roborock home trait's
  room mapping (the parsed `MapData.rooms` carries only segment numbers and geometry).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-19

Initial release of the companion integration (Milestone 3).

### Added

- **Map data sensor per vacuum** — AnyVac reads the parsed `MapData` (robot
  position, charger, cleaning path, rooms and calibration points) from the
  official Roborock integration's runtime coordinators and exposes it as a sensor
  with the data in its attributes. No second Roborock connection and no manual
  calibration: the pixel↔mm `calibration_points` come straight from the parser.
- **Zero-config setup** — single-step config flow; vacuums are discovered from the
  existing Roborock integration automatically.
- Defensive reads of the Roborock integration's internal structures, so a changed
  upstream layout yields no data rather than an error.
